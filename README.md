The user enters the necessary information and clicks the "Save" button to add the media file to the collection. If any required fields are missing, an error message is displayed. The added media is then stored in the app's state and can be viewed and accessed by the user.

## Search Media

- **Description:** The "Search Media" feature allows users to search for specific files within their collection based on file names.
- **How it works:** The search functionality is implemented using an input field where the user can enter keywords related to the file they are looking for.
